# spiderman: The weaving project manager
`spiderman` is a utility for managing digital projects, be it software, electronics, art or anything else.
It is designed to automate the organization of your projects by associating each project with a set of _tags_ and then generating and maintaining a set of _views_
based on these tags.

Each view is a directory structure with the deepest level being symbolic links to the actual project directories. 
Views are defines through _schemas_ which define how the directory hierarchy should be constructed based on project tags and fixed directory elements.

## Example
